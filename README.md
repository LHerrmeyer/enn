# enn: A Neural Network from Scratch, written in C
Explainable Neural Network written in C, designed for teaching how neural networks work in depth.

## Build

To build, run `make`. To enable debug flags, run `make EFLAGS=-g`.

## Roadmap

### Done
- Linalg, NN, data structs, main files
### Not Done
- Testing folder
- Seperate into src, build folders
- Linalg functions (mcpy, add, subtract, mul, div, transpose, possibly gauss elim?)
- CMake
- Tutorial book
- Normalizer
- Functional prog headers
- Working Feedforward NN
- Write in functional style
